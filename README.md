# Online-Ai-Email-for-leave-approval
An intelligent web-based application that automates the process of leave request approvals using AI. Users submit leave requests in natural language (e.g., "Fever for 2 days, inform HR"), and the system generates a formal email using models. The generated email is then sent to the appropriate authority via Gmail using Python's SMTP.
