Dear HR Manager,

I am writing to request a leave of absence from work due to fever. I am hoping to recover soon and would like to take this opportunity to ensure that I am able to return to work as soon as possible.

I am a dedicated employee and would like to assure you that I will make my best effort to meet my work expectations during my absence.

I would be grateful if you could consider my request and let me know your decision.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
Pavani
